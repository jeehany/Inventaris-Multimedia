# Backups folder

This folder holds automated backups moved from `.history` or other temporary/backup files.

If you ran `scripts/move_history.ps1` the `.history` contents will be placed here under a timestamped folder `history_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.

You can inspect the files here and delete them permanently when you are confident they are not needed.
